Algorithm will be so: 
	Obviously, we will used depth-first search algorithm with vector. Firstly, we should find all the possible ways from vertex to another vertex.
	When we will launch the program, DFS function will check all vertices, which is used. During the checking, we through the vector write values to path.
	After all checkings, path will consist all vertices. So, we will find any path between two edges.
