If undirected graph has N vertices, so we know it's minimum amount of edges equals to N - 1.
Hence, it is simple tree. If amount of edges equals to N - 2, components of graph is disconnected. 
For instance, 		here we see, that graph not connected.
	   0           0
		\
		0
As a resutl, I can say, that graph is disconnected, when it's amount of edges less than N - 1.
